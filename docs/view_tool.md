# Overview

The `smold/tools/view_tool.py` file defines `ViewTool`, a tool for the SmolD agent to read and display the content of files from the local filesystem. It's designed to handle text files, with options for pagination (offset and limit of lines). It also includes special handling for image files and Jupyter notebooks, guiding the agent to use other tools or informing it about content types. Lines longer than a certain length are truncated, and the output is prepended with line numbers similar to `cat -n`.

# Key Components

-   **`ViewTool` class (inherits from `smolagents.Tool`)**:
    *   **`name`**: "View"
    *   **`description`**: Explains that the tool retrieves file contents. It mandates an absolute `file_path`. It details the default behavior (up to 2,000 lines from the start) and optional `offset` and `limit` parameters for large files. It mentions that long lines (over 2,000 chars) are truncated. It also notes special handling: "If the target is an image, the tool will render it for you" (though the implementation returns a message about images) and "For Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb), use ReadNotebook instead."
    *   **`inputs`**:
        *   `file_path` (string, required): The absolute path to the file.
        *   `offset` (number, optional): Line number to start reading from (0-indexed, defaults to 0). Meant for large files.
        *   `limit` (number, optional): Maximum number of lines to read (defaults to `MAX_LINES` which is 2000). Meant for large files.
    *   **`output_type`**: "string" (The file content with line numbers, or an error/info message).
    *   **Constants**:
        *   `MAX_LINES`: 2000 (Default and maximum limit for lines to read).
        *   `MAX_LINE_LENGTH`: 2000 (Maximum characters per line before truncation).
        *   `TRUNCATED_LINE_SUFFIX`: "... (line truncated)" (Appended to lines exceeding `MAX_LINE_LENGTH`).
        *   `TRUNCATED_FILE_MESSAGE`: "(Result truncated - total length: {length} characters)" (Appended if the overall output limit is hit, though the current logic primarily truncates based on `limit` parameter).
    *   **Core Logic (`forward(file_path: str, offset: Optional[int] = 0, limit: Optional[int] = None) -> str`)**:
        1.  Ensures `file_path` is absolute.
        2.  Validates that `file_path` exists and is a file. Returns an error if not.
        3.  **MIME Type Check**: Guesses the MIME type.
            *   If it's an image (`image/*`), calls `_handle_image_file()`.
            *   If it's a Jupyter notebook (`.ipynb`), returns a message to use `ReadNotebook` tool.
        4.  Sets `limit` (max `MAX_LINES`) and ensures `offset` is non-negative.
        5.  **File Reading**:
            *   Tries to read the file lines using multiple encodings (`utf-8`, `latin-1`, `cp1252`).
            *   If all text encodings fail, it attempts to open in binary mode (`'rb'`) and returns a message "This file contains binary content that cannot be displayed as text."
        6.  **Content Processing & Formatting**:
            *   Iterates through the lines of the `file_content`.
            *   Skips lines before `offset - 1` (adjusting for 0-indexed `i` vs 1-indexed `offset`).
            *   Stops after `limit` lines have been processed.
            *   Truncates individual lines longer than `MAX_LINE_LENGTH`.
            *   Prepends each displayed line with its 1-indexed line number (e.g., "   1\tcontent of line 1\n").
        7.  Appends `TRUNCATED_FILE_MESSAGE` if `truncated` flag was set (though the logic for setting `truncated` seems to be primarily tied to the `limit` parameter rather than overall character count).
        8.  Returns the formatted string.
    *   **Helper Method (`_handle_image_file(file_path: str, mime_type: str) -> str`)**:
        *   Currently returns a message: "This is an image file ({mime_type}). Images are supported in certain environments but not in a text-only interface." (The description says "render it for you", but implementation differs).

# Important Variables/Constants

(Listed under `ViewTool` class component)

# Usage Examples

The agent uses this tool to inspect file contents.

**Agent viewing a Python file:**

```python
# User: "Show me the contents of 'utils.py'."
# Agent determines the absolute path, e.g., /home/user/project/src/utils.py
result = view_tool.forward(file_path="/home/user/project/src/utils.py")
print(result)
# Output:
#      1	import os
#      2
#      3	def helper_function():
#      4	    # This is a very long line that will exceed the MAX_LINE_LENGTH and will therefore be truncated at the end... (line truncated)
#      5	    return "done"
#   ... (up to 2000 lines)
```

**Agent viewing a specific part of a large log file:**

```python
# User: "View lines 100 to 110 of 'large.log'."
# Agent calculates offset and limit. Note: offset in tool is 0-indexed.
# If user means 1-indexed lines 100-110, offset should be 99, limit 11.
result = view_tool.forward(file_path="/var/log/large.log", offset=99, limit=11)
print(result)
# Output:
#     99	Log entry for line 99
#    100	Log entry for line 100
#    ...
#    109	Log entry for line 109
```

**Agent attempting to view an image:**
```python
result = view_tool.forward(file_path="/path/to/image.png")
print(result)
# Output:
# This is an image file (image/png). Images are supported in certain environments but not in a text-only interface.
```

# Dependencies and Interactions

-   **Standard Libraries**:
    *   `os`: Used for path operations (`path.isabs`, `path.abspath`, `path.exists`, `path.isfile`).
    *   `mimetypes`: Used to guess the MIME type of a file for special handling of images.
    *   `base64`: (Imported but not directly used in the provided code for `ViewTool`. Could be for a planned image rendering feature).
    *   `pathlib.Path`: (Imported but `os.path` functions are predominantly used).
-   **`smolagents.Tool`**: The base class.
-   **Other Tools**:
    *   **ReadNotebook**: The tool explicitly tells the agent to use `ReadNotebook` for `.ipynb` files.
    *   **EditTool**: The description for `EditTool` advises using `ViewTool` first to understand the context before making edits.

This tool is fundamental for the agent's ability to understand the content of files it interacts with. The line numbering and truncation features help manage potentially large or complex files in a text-based interaction model. The special handling for images and notebooks guides the agent appropriately.
