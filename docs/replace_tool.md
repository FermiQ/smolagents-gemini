# Overview

The `smold/tools/replace_tool.py` file defines `WriteTool` (though the class instance is named `write_tool`, its `name` attribute is "Replace"). This tool is designed for writing content to a file, effectively creating a new file or completely overwriting an existing one. It is distinct from the `EditTool`, which is meant for partial, in-place modifications. The tool resolves relative paths based on the agent's current working directory.

*Self-correction: The tool's class name is `WriteTool`, but its `name` attribute exposed to the LLM is "Replace". The documentation should reflect this distinction if necessary, but for clarity on its function, "WriteTool" is more descriptive of its action (writing/replacing content).*

# Key Components

-   **`WriteTool` class (inherits from `smolagents.Tool`)**:
    *   **`name`**: "Replace" (This is the name the LLM will use to refer to the tool).
    *   **`description`**: Instructs the LLM that this tool writes data to a file, replacing any existing file. It clarifies that relative paths are resolved from the current working directory. It also provides pre-requisites:
        *   Use "ReadFile" tool (likely `ViewTool`) to understand the current file's content and context before overwriting.
        *   Use "LS" tool to confirm the parent directory exists and is correct when creating a new file.
    *   **`inputs`**:
        *   `file_path` (string, required): The path to the file to write. Relative paths are resolved.
        *   `content` (string, required): The full content to be written to the file.
    *   **`output_type`**: "string" (a success or error message).
    *   **Constant**:
        *   `MAX_LINES`: 16000 (Used to limit the preview snippet in the success message for updated files).
    *   **Core Logic (`forward(file_path: str, content: str) -> str`)**:
        1.  **Path Resolution**: If `file_path` is relative, it's converted to an absolute path based on the current working directory (`os.path.abspath()`).
        2.  **Parent Directory Check**: Verifies that the parent directory of `file_path` exists. If not, returns an error.
        3.  **Existing File Checks (if applicable)**:
            *   If `file_path` exists, checks if it's a regular file (not a directory). Returns an error if it's not a file.
            *   Checks if the existing file is writable (`os.access(file_path, os.W_OK)`). Returns an error if not.
        4.  **Write Operation**:
            *   Opens `file_path` in write mode (`'w'`) with UTF-8 encoding. This will create the file if it doesn't exist or truncate (overwrite) it if it does.
            *   Writes the provided `content` to the file.
        5.  **Success Message**:
            *   If the file was newly created, returns a simple success message with the file path.
            *   If an existing file was updated (overwritten), it generates a preview of the new content (up to `MAX_LINES`) with `cat -n` style line numbering and returns a success message including this preview.
        6.  **Error Handling**: Catches any exceptions during the write process and returns an error message.

-   **`write_tool = WriteTool()`**: A global instance of `WriteTool` is created, making it available for import and registration with the agent.

# Important Variables/Constants

-   `MAX_LINES` (class constant): Limits the number of lines shown in the preview snippet for updated files.

# Usage Examples

The agent uses this tool to create new files or completely replace the content of existing ones.

**Agent creating a new configuration file:**

```python
# User: "Create a file named 'app.conf' in the 'config' directory with the content 'host=localhost\nport=8080'."
# Agent first uses LSTool to ensure 'config' directory exists or creates it if necessary (using EditTool or BashTool).
# Then, agent uses WriteTool (as "Replace").
result = write_tool.forward(
    file_path="./config/app.conf",  # Assuming cwd is the project root
    content="host=localhost\nport=8080"
)
# Output:
# File created successfully at: /abs/path/to/project/config/app.conf
```

**Agent overwriting an existing README file:**

```python
# User: "Replace the content of README.md with 'This is the new project description.'"
# Agent might first use ViewTool to see the old README.
result = write_tool.forward(
    file_path="README.md", # Assuming cwd is where README.md is
    content="This is the new project description."
)
# Output:
# The file /abs/path/to/project/README.md has been updated. Here's the result of running `cat -n` on a snippet of the edited file:
#      1	This is the new project description.
```

**Agent encounters an error (parent directory does not exist):**

```python
result = write_tool.forward(
    file_path="./non_existent_parent/new_file.txt",
    content="Some data"
)
# Output:
# Error: Parent directory '/abs/path/to/project/non_existent_parent' does not exist
```

# Dependencies and Interactions

-   **Standard Libraries**:
    *   `os`: Extensively used for path operations (`path.isabs`, `path.abspath`, `path.dirname`, `path.exists`, `path.isfile`, `access`) and determining if a file existed before the operation.
    *   `pathlib.Path`: (Imported but `os.path` functions are predominantly used).
-   **`smolagents.Tool`**: The base class.
-   **Other Tools**:
    *   **ViewTool (or "ReadFileTool")**: The description advises the LLM to use a tool to read the file first if it's being overwritten, to understand its context.
    *   **LSTool**: Advised for confirming parent directory existence before creating a new file.
    *   **EditTool**: This tool is for complete content replacement, contrasting with `EditTool` which is for partial, targeted modifications.

This tool provides a straightforward way for the agent to manage entire file contents. The distinction between this and `EditTool` is important for the LLM to understand when choosing the right tool for a file modification task. The preview for updated files helps in verifying the operation.
